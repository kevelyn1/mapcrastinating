## About

I'm a geographer by heart and by education. Currenty, I'm Assoc. Professor in Geoinformatics and Head of Department of Geography at University of Tartu, Estonia. I hold a PhD in landscape ecology and environmental protection and my research interests evolve around the interactions of land use/land cover and water quality, landscape changes and geospatial modelling with machine learning. My special interests are geospatial visualisation and map design. I'm always keen on trying new visualisation methods and especially with the focus on making maps nice fast with open-source software like QGIS and Blender. I teach several MSc level courses at the University of Tartu, including Spatial Data Studio, Introduction to QGIS, Spatial Data Analysis, Landscape Planning. I also provide some lab sessions in Hydrology and Landscape Ecology courses. In my free time, I enjoy tramping, cooking, drawing, reading, spending active time with my four kids and partner.
