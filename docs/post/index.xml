      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure where the paper cut style originates but I guess it has been around in the design world already long time. However, likely one of the first GIS-approaches was done by John Nelson with ArcPro. This is also available as style for ArcPro. However, I aimed to create the same style with QGIS and the mapping theme was inspired by the beautiful snow this winter in Estonia.
For input data you would need any numerical point data (rain, temperature, snow etc.</description>

      <description>Tanaka contours aka illuminated contours is terrain visualization method developed first by Prof. Tanaka Kitirito in 1950. The mimics 3D by illuminating the northwestern slopes and shading the opposite slopes. I followed Anita Graser&amp;rsquo;s tutorial to create Tanaka contours and updated it a bit as QGIS has evolved since then. Her tutorial was inspired by Hannes Kr√∂ger&amp;rsquo;s attempt to create the effect using QGIS.
You need a DEM for creating Tanaka contours.</description>
