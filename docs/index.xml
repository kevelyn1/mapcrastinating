      <description>Tanaka contours aka illuminated contours is terrain visualization method developed first by Prof. Tanaka Kitirito in 1950. The mimics 3D by illuminating the northwestern slopes and shading the opposite slopes. I followed Anita Graser&amp;rsquo;s tutorial to create Tanaka contours and updated it a bit as QGIS has evolved since then. Her tutorial was inspired by Hannes Kr√∂ger&amp;rsquo;s attempt to create the effect using QGIS.
You need a DEM for creating Tanaka contoours.</description>

      <description>About I&amp;rsquo;m a geographer by heart and by education. Currenty, I&amp;rsquo;m Assoc. Professor in Geoinformatics and Head of Department of Geography at University of Tartu, Estonia. I hold a PhD in landscape ecology and environmental protection and my research interests evolve around the interactions of land use/land cover and water quality, landscape changes and geospatial modelling with machine learning. My special interests are geospatial visualisation and map design. I&amp;rsquo;m always keen on trying new visualisation methods and especially with the focus on making maps nice fast with open-source software like QGIS and Blender.</description>
